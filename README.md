# Automated-Receipt-Tracker
## Project Overview

This project provides an automated solution for processing receipts using Amazon Web Services (AWS). Traditional manual receipt handling is often time-consuming, prone to errors, and does not scale effectively.

This system addresses these challenges by automatically extracting structured data from receipts. The data is then stored efficiently in a centralized location, streamlining record-keeping and simplifying auditing processes.

Excellent, this clearly outlines the components. Let’s refine this to better explain how the components interact.

Here are two improved versions.

Architecture
The project’s architecture is composed of the following AWS services:

Amazon S3 (Storage Layer): Stores all incoming receipt files, including images and PDFs. This acts as the entry point for the processing workflow.
AWS Lambda (Compute Layer): Provides the serverless compute logic that automates the workflow. Lambda functions are triggered by new files in S3 and coordinate the other services.
Amazon Textract (Processing Layer): Performs AI-powered OCR to automatically extract structured data, such as vendor names, dates, and line items, from the receipts.
Amazon DynamoDB (Database Layer): A NoSQL database used to store the extracted receipt data in a structured, queryable format for long-term record-keeping.
Amazon SES (Notification System): The Simple Email Service is used to send automated email alerts to users, confirming successful receipt processing and providing key details.

# 1. Set Up S3 Buckets for Receipt Storage and Archiving
The receipt processing system needs a central, secure location to store both the original receipt files and track their processing status.

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) provides the ideal solution with its durability, availability, and security features. This bucket will serve as both the entry point for new receipts and the archive for processed documents.

Steps
Sign in to the AWS Management Console
Navigate to the Amazon S3 service

Creating the S3 Bucket
Click the Create bucket button to open the bucket creation wizard.
Provide a unique and descriptive name for your bucket (e.g., your-project-receipts). This bucket will store all your receipt files.
In the Bucket type section, ensure that General purpose is selected.
Press enter or click to view image in full size

Note: S3 Buckets Must Be Globally Unique

Your bucket name must be unique across all existing bucket names in all of AWS. To ensure uniqueness, it’s a best practice to add a personal identifier to the name.

Example: automated-receipts-yourusername

❗Important: Keep all default settings for the bucket configuration

Finalize Bucket Creation
Finally, scroll to the bottom of the page and click the Create bucket button. AWS will validate your settings and create the bucket, after which you will be redirected to the S3 console where your new bucket will appear in the list.

Create an “incoming” Folder (Recommended)
To keep files organized by their processing status, we recommend creating a dedicated folder for new receipt uploads.

Navigate into your bucket: From the S3 console, click on the name of the bucket you just created.
Initiate folder creation: Click the Create folder button.
Name the folder: In the Folder name field, enter incoming and then click Create folder at the bottom of the page.
Press enter or click to view image in full size

Role of the S3 Bucket
The Amazon S3 bucket is the foundation of the workflow, serving a dual role as both the trigger for processing and the long-term archive for all receipts.

The process begins when a user or automated system uploads a receipt image or PDF into the incoming/ folder. This upload event automatically triggers an AWS Lambda function, which initiates the data extraction. Throughout this process, the original receipt file is securely preserved in the bucket, creating a permanent and auditable record for compliance and verification purposes.

#2 Create a DynamoDB Table for Receipt Data
Once the system extracts structured data from a receipt, it requires a durable and high-performance database to store that information. For this purpose, we will use Amazon DynamoDB.

Why DynamoDB?
DynamoDB is an ideal choice for this serverless application for several key reasons:

Serverless: It is a fully managed service, which means there is no need to provision or manage servers, patch software, or handle other administrative tasks.
Scalability: It scales seamlessly to handle virtually any amount of data or traffic, ensuring the application remains responsive as usage grows.
Performance: It delivers consistent, single-digit millisecond latency, which is essential for a responsive system.
Steps
Navigate to DynamoDB in the AWS Console
Press enter or click to view image in full size

Create the Table
Click the Create table button to open the creation interface. This table will store all the structured data extracted from your receipts.
Press enter or click to view image in full size

1. Table name

Enter Receipts.
2. Partition key

Enter receipt_id for the key name and select String as the key type.
Note: The partition key is a unique identifier for each receipt stored in the table. This ID will be generated automatically by the processing Lambda function.

3. Sort key

Enter date for the key name and select String as the key type.
Note: Adding a sort key allows for more powerful queries, such as retrieving all receipts within a specific date range. We’ll use a YYYY-MM-DD format to ensure it sorts correctly.

Press enter or click to view image in full size

Review and Create Table
Accept default settings: You can leave all other settings below the sort key with their default values.
Create the table: Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the Create table button.
AWS will now provision your DynamoDB table, which is typically ready in under a minute. You will be redirected to the tables dashboard, where you’ll see your new Receipts table in the list.

Press enter or click to view image in full size

Understanding the Initial Table State
After creating the Receipts table, you will see it listed in the DynamoDB console with a status of Active and showing 0 items. This is the correct and expected state.

The table will only be populated with data after the complete processing workflow is triggered. An empty table simply confirms that it has been configured correctly and is ready to receive data once the system is running.

Data Model for Receipt Information

The DynamoDB table will store the following attributes for each receipt:

Press enter or click to view image in full size

The DynamoDB table serves as the structured data repository for all processed receipts:

The Lambda function extracts data from receipts using Amazon Textract
The extracted data is formatted according to the data model
The Lambda function writes this data to the DynamoDB table
Applications and reports can query the table for receipt information
The original receipt images remain in S3, linked via the receipt_url attribute
3.3 Notification Setup: Configuring Amazon SES
Steps to be Performed
Setting up SES for Email Notifications.
Verifying the Email Address.
Configuring SES for Receipt Notifications.
#1 Setting up SES for Email Notifications
After receipts are processed, users need to be notified about the extracted information and any actions required.

Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) provides a reliable, cost-effective email solution for sending these notifications. Setting up SES ensures that appropriate stakeholders are informed when new receipts are processed.

Navigate to Amazon SES in the AWS Console
Press enter or click to view image in full size

Access Identity Management
In the SES console, go to Configuration > Identities
This section is where you’ll verify email addresses or domains
Press enter or click to view image in full size

Begin Identity Creation
Click the Create identity button
This starts the process of verifying an email address or domain for sending
Press enter or click to view image in full size

Select Identity Type
Select Email address option
Note: For production systems, you might want to verify an entire domain instead

Press enter or click to view image in full size

Configure Sender Email
Enter your sender email address (the address you’ll send notifications from)
Best practice: Use a business email or a dedicated notification address
Example: receipts-noreply@yourcompany.com
Complete Initial Setup
Click Create identity
AWS will process your request and prepare verification
Press enter or click to view image in full size

#2 Verifying the Email Address
After creating the identity, navigate to your Gmail inbox and perform the verification steps as provided below:

Verify Sender Email
AWS will send a verification email to the address you provided
This verification ensures you own the email address
Check both inbox and spam/junk folders for this email
Press enter or click to view image in full size

Complete Verification
Go to the inbox of that email address and find the AWS verification email
Click the verification link in that email
Press enter or click to view image in full size

You’ll be redirected to a confirmation page in AWS
Press enter or click to view image in full size

#3 Configuring SES for Receipt Notifications
❗Important: Email Verification Options

Option 1: Use the same email for sender and recipient (simplest approach)
Verify only one email address to use for both sending and receiving notifications
This is recommended for tutorial and testing purposes
Option 2: Use different sender and recipient emails
Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each recipient email address
Remember: While in SES sandbox mode, both sender and recipient emails must be verified
Press enter or click to view image in full size

The SES configuration enables the notification component of the receipt processing workflow:

After the Lambda function processes a receipt and stores data in DynamoDB
It uses SES to send an email notification with receipt details
The notification includes key information like vendor, date, amount, and a link to the original receipt
Users receive timely updates without needing to check the system manually
3.4 Processing Setup: Creating a Lambda function
Steps to be Performed
Create an IAM role for AWS Lambda.
Create a Lambda Function.

# Integration and Testing
Steps to be Performed
Setup S3 Event Notification Trigger.
Test the Project Execution.
Project Improvement Ideas.
## 1. Setup S3 Event Notification Trigger
For our receipt processing system to operate automatically, we need to establish a trigger that will invoke our Lambda function whenever a new receipt is uploaded.

Amazon S3 offers event notifications that can detect new file uploads and trigger specific actions. This integration creates the vital connection between file upload (input) and processing (execution).

Navigate to S3 in the AWS Console
Press enter or click to view image in full size

Access Your Bucket
From the list of buckets, select the receipt storage bucket you created earlier
This opens the bucket management interface
Press enter or click to view image in full size

Click “Save” to activate the event notification
AWS will validate and create the notification configuration
Press enter or click to view image in full size

The S3 event notification creates the automated workflow for receipt processing:

When a receipt image is uploaded to S3, it generates an event
The event notification system detects this upload event
If the file matches the configured prefix and suffix filters, S3 invokes the Lambda function
The Lambda function receives event data including the bucket name and file key
Processing begins automatically without any manual intervention
## 2. Test the Project Execution
This point explains how to verify your receipt processing system works correctly end-to-end.

## Step 1: Upload a Test Receipt

Of course. Here is a more structured and descriptive version of your project enhancement list.
Project Enhancements
Here are several ways to expand upon the core functionality of your receipt processing system, grouped by theme.

User Interface & Experience
Implement a Web Upload Form Host a static HTML page on Amazon S3 with a simple form, allowing users to upload receipts directly through a browser instead of just using the S3 console.
Track Processing Status Add a status attribute to your DynamoDB items. Update it throughout the workflow with values like Pending, Processing, Success, or Failed to provide clear feedback on a receipt's state.
Core Features & Data
Add Expense Categorization Modify the DynamoDB table and Lambda function to include an expense category field. This allows for better organization of spending into buckets like "Food," "Travel," or "Office Supplies."
Generate Monthly Reports Create a new Lambda function that runs on a schedule (e.g., using Amazon EventBridge). This function can query DynamoDB for the month’s expenses, generate a summary, and email it to a user via SES.
Operations & Efficiency
Set Up Error Notifications Use Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) to send an immediate alert to an administrator if the processing Lambda function encounters an error. This enables faster troubleshooting.
Optimize Image Storage Add a step to your Lambda function to compress or resize receipt images before they are archived. This can significantly reduce long-term S3 storage costs.
Security
Introduce User Authentication Integrate Amazon Cognito to manage user accounts. This adds a secure sign-up and sign-in layer to your web interface, ensuring that only authorized users can upload and view receipts.
